/* This module provides an implementation for Silent Payments, as specified in BIP352.
 * This particularly involves the creation of input tweak data by summing up private
 * or public keys and the derivation of a shared secret using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman.
 * Combined are either:
 *   - spender's private keys and recipient's public key (a * B, sender side)
 *   - spender's public keys and recipient's private key (A * b, recipient side)
 * With this result, the necessary key material for ultimately creating/scanning
 * or spending Silent Payment outputs can be determined.
 *
 * Note that this module is _not_ a full implementation of BIP352, as it
 * inherently doesn't deal with higher-level concepts like addresses, output
 * script types or transactions. The intent is to provide a module for abstracting away
 * the elliptic-curve operations required for the protocol. For any wallet software already
 * using libsecp256k1, this API should provide all the functions needed for a Silent Payments
 * implementation without requiring any further elliptic-curve operations from the wallet.

/* This struct serves as an In param for passing the silent payment address data.
 * The index field is for when more than one address is being sent to in a transaction. Index is
 * set based on the original ordering of the addresses and used to return the generated outputs
 * matching the original ordering. When more than one recipient is used the recipient array
 * will be sorted in place as part of generating the outputs, but the generated outputs will be
 * outputs will be returned original ordering specified by the index to ensure the caller is able
 * to match up the generated outputs to the correct silent payment address (e.g. to be able to
 * assign the correct amounts to the correct generatetd outputs in the final transaction).

/** Create Silent Payment outputs for recipient(s).
 *
 * Given a list of n private keys a_1...a_n (one for each silent payment
 * eligible input to spend), a serialized outpoint, and a list of recipients,
 * create the taproot outputs:
 *
 * a_sum = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n
 * input_hash = hash(outpoint_smallest || (a_sum * G))
 * taproot_output = B_spend + hash(a_sum * input_hash * B_scan || k) * G
 *
 * If necessary, the private keys are negated to enforce the right y-parity.
 * For that reason, the private keys have to be passed in via two different parameter
 * pairs, depending on whether the seckeys correspond to x-only outputs or not.
 *
 *  Returns: 1 if creation of outputs was successful. 0 if an error occured.
 *   Args:                 ctx: pointer to a context object
 *    Out:   generated_outputs: pointer to an array of pointers to xonly pubkeys, one per recipient.
 *                              The order of outputs here matches the original ordering of the
 *                              recipients array.
 *     In:          recipients: pointer to an array of pointers to silent payment recipients,
 *                              where each recipient is a scan public key, a spend public key, and
 *                              an index indicating its position in the original ordering.
 *                              The recipient array will be sorted in place, but generated outputs
 *                              are saved in the `generated_outputs` array to match the ordering
 *                              from the index field. This ensures the caller is able to match the
 *                              generated outputs to the correct silent payment addresses. The same
 *                              recipient can be passed multiple times to create multiple
 *                              outputs for the same recipient.
 *                n_recipients: the number of recipients. This is equal to the total
 *                              number of outputs to be generated as each recipient may passed
 *                              multiple times to generate multiple outputs for the same recipient
 *         outpoint_smallest36: serialized smallest outpoint
 *             taproot_seckeys: pointer to an array of pointers to 32-byte private keys
 *                              of taproot inputs (can be NULL if no private keys of
 *                              taproot inputs are used)
 *           n_taproot_seckeys: the number of sender's taproot input private keys
